## TODO 
- basic zombie avoidance behavior
- ~~image processing~~ RR 13-Nov
- wall detection and avoidance
- global berry map
- avoiding zombies based on color
- using the gripper

## Immediate Next Steps
- making a turn and then continue moving forward in `robot_control` according to value of `safest_direction`
- how can we move forward, stop, rotate, move forward without exploding?
